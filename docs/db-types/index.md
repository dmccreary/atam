The six types are:

1. [Relational](./01-relational.md)
2. [Analytical](./02-analytical.md) (OLAP Cubes)
3. [Key Value Stores](./03-key-value.md)
4. [Column Family Stores](./04-column-family.md)
5. [Graph](./05-graph.md)
6. [Document](./06-document.md)

Each of these database architectures have many sub-types
and each of these have pros and cons for different applications.
