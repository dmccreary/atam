# The S.T.A.R Process in Writing ATAM Case Studies

We have written hundreds of case studies about how
organzations use the ATAM process.  We use the S.T.A.R approach which stands for:

1. **Situation** - give context to the case study
2. **Task** - what was the challenge being addressed
3. **Approach** - What was the architectural approach?
4. **Results** - What were the results, both measurable and intangible

Here are some details for each of these sections:

## Situation (Context)

This is the backstory where we set the scene and provide the necessary background information. It involves describing the context within which the events or challenges occurred. For a case study, this would include details about the organization, the environment, specific circumstances, or any other relevant information that gives a clear picture of the scenario.

## Task (Challenge)

Next, we outline the specific challenge or problem that needs to be addressed. It's about what needed to be done and why it was important. In a case study, this could involve a key pain point or the goal that the organization was trying to achieve, or a particular obstacle that needed to be overcome.

## Architectural Approach

In this section, I describe my architectural approach to building a solution. I briefly describe the options on the table and the tradeoff process that I used to select a specific architectural solution. This process details the strategies, processes, or steps taken to tackle the problem. The focus should be on specific actions and why those actions were chosen.

## Results

Finally, we present the outcomes of the approach we took. This is where I showcase the results, achievements, and learnings obtained from the experience. It's important to be as quantifiable as possible, using data and specific examples to illustrate the impact of the actions. I focus on easy-to-measure dollar savings and how the organization is repositioned to be more agile in the future.

We like this method because it provides a clear and logical structure, ensuring that all essential elements of a story or case are covered. It's particularly effective in making complex information more digestible and compelling, leading the audience through a logical progression from problem to solution.
