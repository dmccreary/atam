# Cognitive Bias in Database Selection

After attending the Saturn 2013 Conference I was exposed to the use of "Cognitive Bias" in software architecture.

Here are some examples of cognitive bias I have seen as applied to the world of NoSQL database selection.

## Anchoring Bias

The tendency to produce an estimate near a cue amount.

 **Example:** *"Our managers were expecting an RDBMS solution so thatâ€™s what we gave them."*

## Availability Heuristic

The tendency to estimate that what is easily remembered is more likely than that which is not.

 **Example:** *"I hear that NoSQL does not support ACID."* or *"I hear that XML is verbose."*

## Bandwagon Effect

The tendency to do or believe what others do or believe.

 **Example:** *"Everyone else at this company and in our local area uses RDBMSs."*

## Confirmation Bias

The tendency to seek out only that information that supports one's preconceptions.

 **Example:** *"We only read posts from the Oracle|Microsoft|IBM groups."*

## Framing Effect

The tendency to react to how information is framed, beyond its factual content.

**Example:** "We know of some NoSQL projects that failed."

## Gambler's fallacy

 The failure to reset one's expectations based on one's current situation.
 
 **Example:** *"We already paid for our Oracle|Microsoft|IBM license so why spend more money?"*

 * Also known as: sunk cost bias

## Hindsight Bias

The tendency to assess one's previous decisions as more efficacious than they were.

**Example** *"Our last five systems worked on RDBMS solutions.
Why should we change now?"*

## Halo Effect
The tendency to attribute unverified capabilities in a person based on an observed capability.

**Example:** "Oracle|Microsoft|IBM sells billions of dollars of licenses each year, how could so many people be wrong". 

## Representativeness Heuristic
The tendency to judge something as belonging to a class based on a few salient characteristics  - "Our accounting systems work on RDBMS so why not our product search?"
