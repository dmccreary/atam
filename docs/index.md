# Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Methodology

Welcome to our ATAM website!

This website stores resources for teaching courses
on the Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Methodology (ATAM)
originally developed by Carnegie Mellon University (CMU).

We have adapted ATAM for use in helping organizations find
the best database architecture for a business challenge.
