# ATAM Database Selection Process

![](img/ATAM-db-process.png)

In this section, we take the [Standard ATAM Process](./atam-process.md) and modify
it for the specialized task of selecting the right database architecture for a project.

Developed by the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), ATAM is a risk-mitigation process used in the early stages of software development. Its purpose is to evaluate software architectures and identify potential risks related to achieving quality attribute goals and business objectives. This method helps organizations make informed architectural decisions by uncovering tradeoffs and sensitivity points within the design.
